## Creating new sites for conferences:

Each conference site is a site within the multisite network.

1. Gain access to hosting dashboard
2. Run a backup
3. Add desired domain under "Domains" tab
	* It will likely take a few hours for the DNS status to update to green
4. Under the "CDN" tab, ensure that Enable CDN is checked âœ… for your new domain
5. "Network activate" the [MultiSite Clone Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-clone-duplicator/) plugin
6. Duplicate the most-recent conference site for that conference series
	* Use largo@inn.org for the admin email address
7. If needed, set up a domain mapping for the subdomain, if the conference uses a domain other than `gijn.org`
